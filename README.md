# RMS Camera
Python scripts for collecting and creating GIFs or MP4s of NSW RMS traffic camera images. Cameras can be viewed on [livetraffic.com](https://www.livetraffic.com/desktop.html#cameraview)


## collect.py
This script polls _rms.nsw.gov.au_ for new traffic camera images every 30 seconds. If a new image is found, it is downloaded and (optionally) filtered. The filtered images are saved in their own directories. New images are received from cameras evey minute Â± 15 seconds.

```
usage: collect.py [-h] [-c CAMERA] [-p PATH] [--filter]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
  -c CAMERA   Traffic camera name
  -p PATH     Path to save images (default="./download")
  --filter    Enable image filtering (default=false)
```


### Examples
```
python collect.py -c anzacbr

python collect.py --filter -c anzacbr -p "Anzac Bridge"
```

### Filtering
Each individual frame can optionally be filtered with a [PIL/Pillow ImageFilter](http://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/3.4.x/reference/ImageFilter.html) using the `--filter` switch. If enabled, the images are passed through a separate Detail and Sharpen filter. The output of each filter is placed in `<PATH>/filtered/detail` and `<PATH>/filtered/sharpen` respectively.

Unfiltered | Detail | Sharpen
-----------| ------ | -------
![Unfiltered](images/raw.jpg) | ![Detail](images/detail.jpg) | ![Sharpen](images/sharpen.jpg)

### File naming
Downloaded images are named based on the camera they were captured by, and a UNIX timestamp of when they were downloaded. Example:
```
anzacbr-1496647687.878115.jpg
```


### Cameras
Valid camera names can be found in [cameras.md](cameras.md). Camera positions and directions can be viewed on the [livetraffic.com](https://www.livetraffic.com/desktop.html) map.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
  -i INPUT    Path to folder containing images
  -o OUTPUT   Path to save GIF (default="./anim.gif")
  -f FPS      GIF FPS (default=8)
```


### Examples
